\section{Introduction}

Combustion engines, such as those used to power passenger cars, require precise control over their operation in order to run efficiently and reliably.
Since the early 1970s, car engines have been electronically controlled by an EMS (engine management system) \cite{JapanSemi}.
An EMS is an embedded system consisting of an ECU (electronic control unit), sensors, and actuators.
The actuators include fuel injectors and spark plugs.
The sensors measure crankshaft angle, intake manifold pressure, coolant temperature, and so on.
The ECU features a microcontroller that uses feedback from these sensor data to operate the actuators, thus allowing the engine to run.

Sensor data are used not only by the ECU, but also by a display system mounted in the cabin that allows the driver to monitor the engine's health.
The display system is typically a set of gauges showing, for instance, engine speed, oil pressure, and coolant temperature, among other things.

The display system must visually encode sensor data and convey them to the driver.
Each datum represents the instantaneous value of a continuous quantity---speed, temperature, pressure, etc.
The data are most effectively represented by a graduated radial analog scale with the instantaneous value marked on said scale \cite{Panchal2025}.
The graduated scale takes advantage of vernier acuity: our ability to discern slight misalignment between line segments \cite{Strasburger2018}, while the radial marker leverages the hypercolumnar acuity of vision: our ability to detect minute changes in angle of line segments \cite{Hubel1962}.
Simply put, an analog needle gauge is the best way to display information to the driver.
It is the reason why even modern digital display systems are often skeuomorphs of analog gauges, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:Stack}.

	\label{fig:Stack}
\end{figure}

As engine performance increases, the operating window where it will run reliably shrinks, necessitating even tighter control.
This drives demand for even more sensor data, both for the ECU---to precisely regulate the running of the engine---and for the driver, to monitor the engine's health and to ensure that it stays within its safe operating window.

This is especially true in racing, where the engine must be fine-tuned to its limits while remaining reliable for the duration of its life.
Race teams often fit additional sensors and gauges to the car in order to monitor the health of the engine (Fig.~\ref{fig:R31}).

\begin{figure}

	\label{fig:R31}
\end{figure}

All these sensor data must somehow be transmitted throughout the car; a computer network handles this task well.
CAN (controller area network) \cite{can20b} is ubiquitous: introduced by Bosch in the early 1990s and standardized by ISO 11898 \cite{CanHistory}, all cars sold in the United States are required to be equiped with a CAN bus \cite{CFR40.86.1806-05}.

Most modern digital display systems, such as the one shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:Stack9918}, come with a CAN interface, allowing them to display a practically unlimited array of information from whatever sensors may be equiped to the car.
On the other hand, analog gauges have largely been abandoned by manufacturers, as digital panels can display myriad information at a fraction of the cost of an equivalent set of analog gauges.
However, some, including myself, prefer a genuine analog gauge as opposed to a facsimile displayed on a screen.
The trouble is, most analog gauges lack a CAN interface, with only a few companies making CAN-enabled analog gauges, mostly for industrial applications \cite{Vdo}.

Those who wish to install an analog gauge typically do so by installing a sensor on the engine and running a wire directly to the gauge's analog input---this is the setup recommended by most gauge manufacturers \cite{Stack3307Manual}.
While this does work, it is less than ideal for several reasons.

Firstly, running a wire through the engine bay leaves the signal vulnerable to EMI (electromagnetic interference) as it travels near noisy components like the ignition coils.
This can cause signal integrity issues that could have been avoided by transporting the signal via the CAN bus already present in the car.
CAN uses a CRC (cyclic redundancy check) to provide data integrity.

Secondly, the EMS already features a host of sensors, and installing another for the gauge often leads to duplication.
While this may appear to provide redundancy, it in fact does not.
On the contrary, it reduces reliability and increases complexity by introducing additional failure points into the system.
A properly engineered solution would integrate the gauge into the EMS, allowing them to share sensor data, thus reducing the complexity of the system.

This brings us finally to the subject of this paper: a device that allows analog gauges to be retofitted into a car while leveraging the capabilities of the CAN bus already present in the vehicle.
